## üß† Concepts

Edytor structure is built around this key concepts:

- **Blocks**: Container elements like paragraphs, headings, and lists
- **Content**: The content of a block is an array of inlines blocks or text and marks.
- **Children**: Children are the blocks that are directly inside a block. They allow an infinite nesting.
- **Marks**: Texts are simply text with marks that define the formatting.
- **Inline blocks**: Inline blocks are inline elements that are no editable and render custom components like footnotes, equations, etc.

Schematic example of a document:
(content and children are not dom element, i put them here to help you understand the structure)

```html
<root>
	<block>
		<content>
			<text mark="bold">Hello</text>
			<text>World</text>
			<inline-block type="footnote">
				<!-- Inline block are rendered by the user code -->
			</inline-block>
		</content>
		<children>
			<nested-block>
				<content>
					<text>World</text>
				</content>
			</nested-block>
			<nested-block>
				<content>
					<text>World</text>
				</content>
				<children>
					<nested-block>
						<content>
							<text>World</text>
						</content>
					</nested-block>
				</children>
			</nested-block>
		</children>
	</block>
</root>
```

### Blocks

Blocks are the container elements like paragraphs, headings, and lists.
They have a content that is an array of inlines blocks or text.
They may have children that is an array of nested-blocks.
Blocks can be nested unless they are void or inside an island

An island is a block that is editable but is structuraly stable and isolated from the rest of the document.
It is impossible to merge an island with another block. It is also impossible to move another block inside an island.
You may think of an island as a block that is editable but is not completely part of the document structure and isolated from the rest of the document.

A void block is a block which does not have children or whose children are not editable and rendered outside of the edytor core logic.
Void blocks can render and edit their content anyway. That is usefull to render caption.
You may think of a void block as a block that is completely independent from the rest of the document.
Void blocks acts also like an island but are even less editables.

### Text

Text is the basic text element that is rendered by the editor. At is core it is a Y.js text with any formatting attributes you want.

### Inlines Block

Inlines are inline blocks, useful to render custom components like footnotes, equations, etc.
They are rendered by the user code and are not editable nor focusable.
They have a data property

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation (not published yet)

```bash
npm install edytor
# or
yarn add edytor
# or
pnpm add edytor
```

### Basic Usage

```svelte
<script>
	import { Edytor } from 'edytor';

	let value = {
		children: [
			{
				type: 'paragraph',
				content: [{ text: 'Hello, World!' }]
			}
		]
	};

	function onChange(newValue) {
		console.log('Document changed:', newValue);
	}
</script>

<Edytor {value} {onChange} />
```

## üì¶ Plugins

Plugins are the primary way to extend Edytor's functionality. They allow you to add custom blocks, marks, inline blocks, hotkeys, and hook into various editor events. Each plugin is a function that receives the editor instance and returns a set of definitions and operations.

Plugins are best written in Svelte files (`.svelte`) to take full advantage of Svelte's snippets system and template syntax when defining block and mark snippets. You can define snippets for blocks, marks, inline blocks, hotkeys, and operations and still be able to use them inside the `<script module>` `</script>`tag of your file that will export the whole plugin.

### Plugin Structure

A basic plugin structure looks like this:

```typescript
const MyPlugin = (editor: Edytor) => ({
  // Define custom blocks
  blocks: {
    myBlock: {
      snippet: /* Svelte snippet */,
      // ... block options
    }
  },
  // Define custom marks
  marks: {
    myMark: {
      snippet: /* Svelte snippet */,
      // ... mark options
    }
  },
  // Define custom inline blocks
  inlineBlocks: {
    myInline: {
      snippet: /* Svelte snippet */,
      // ... inline block options
    }
  },
  // Define custom hotkeys
  hotkeys: {
    'mod+b': (e) => {
      // Handle hotkey
    }
  },
  // Define plugin operations
  onBeforeOperation: (payload) => {
    // Handle before operation
  },
  // ... other operations
});
```

### Block Definitions

Blocks are the fundamental building blocks of the editor. They can be paragraphs, headings, lists, or any custom block type.

### Prevention in Plugin Operations

Many plugin operations and hotkeys receive a `prevent` function as part of their payload. This function is a crucial part of Edytor's plugin system that allows you to:

1. Stop the default behavior of an operation
2. Register a callback to be executed after the default operation is aborted
3. Control the flow of operations across multiple plugins

Here's how it works:

```typescript
// In a hotkey handler precent will also doest a preventDefault on the keyboard event.
hotkeys: {
  'mod+b': ({ prevent }) => {
    // Prevent default and do nothing
    prevent();

    // Or register a callback to be executed after the operation is aborted
    prevent(() => {
      // This code runs after the default operation is aborted
      // Use this to implement your custom behavior
    });
  }
}

// In an operation handler
onBeforeOperation: ({ prevent, operation, payload }) => {
  if (operation === 'splitBlock') {
    prevent(() => {
      // This callback will be executed after the default split operation is aborted
      // Implement your custom split logic here
    });
  }
}
```

When using multiple plugins, prevention follows these rules:

- If a plugin prevents an operation without providing a callback, the operation is completely stopped
- If a plugin prevents an operation with a callback, the default operation is aborted and then the callback is executed
- If multiple plugins try to prevent the same operation, only the first prevention (in plugin order) takes effect
- If a plugin doesn't call prevent(), the operation continues to the next plugin or executes the default behavior

This system allows plugins to:

- Completely stop operations when needed
- Replace default behavior with custom logic
- Ensure their custom logic runs only after the default behavior is properly aborted
- Build complex features while maintaining predictable behavior

### Example: Simple Bold Mark Plugin

```svelte

<script module>
	export const boldPlugin = (editor: Edytor) => ({
		marks: {
			bold: {
			snippet: bold
		}
	},
	hotkeys: {
		'mod+b': ({prevent}) => {
			prevent(()=>{
				// Do something
			});
		}
	}
});
</script>

{#snippet bold({content}: MarkSnippetPayload)}
	<strong>{@render content()}</strong>
{/snippet}
```

### Using Plugins

To use plugins, pass them to the Edytor component. The order of the plugins is important because the plugins are executed in the order they are passed. So if two plugins are trying to render the same block, the first plugin will win. If two pluggins defined the same hotkey and prevent it, the second plugin will not be executed.

```svelte
<script>
	import { Edytor } from 'edytor';
	import { BoldPlugin, HeadingPlugin } from './plugins';

	const plugins = [BoldPlugin, HeadingPlugin];
</script>

<Edytor {plugins} />
```

## Testing

I'm welcome to any contribution to improve the testing.
In the end, every block operation should be tested.
I've implemented a custom jsx parser to simplify testing the editor.

So instead of defining the value as a json object, you can define the value as a jsx element.

```html
<root>
	<paragraph>Hello, World!</paragraph>
</root>
```

is the same as

```json
{
	"type": "root",
	"children": [{ "type": "paragraph", "content": [{ "text": "Hello, World!" }] }]
}
```

You can also add one or two cursors with the `|` character into the jsx in order to simulate the cursor position

```jsx
<root>
	<paragraph>Hello, |World!|</paragraph>
</root>
```

I've also implemented the `createTestEdytor` that help with creating an edytor instance from a jsx element in order to test various operations on a virtual edytor and test the expected output.

```jsx
test('split text', () => {
	const { edytor, expect } = createTestEdytor(
		<root>
			<paragraph>Hello, |World!</paragraph>
		</root>
	);

	edytor.selection.state.startBlock?.splitBlock({
		index: edytor.selection.state.yStart,
		text: edytor.selection.state.startText
	});

	expect(
		<root>
			<paragraph>Hello, </paragraph>
			<paragraph>World!</paragraph>
		</root>
	);
});
```

### Plugin Error Handling and Validation

Edytor provides comprehensive error boundaries and validation for plugins to ensure that plugin failures don't crash the entire editor.

#### Plugin Validation

When plugins are initialized, Edytor automatically validates:
- Plugin returns a valid object
- All marks, blocks, and inlineBlocks are properly defined
- All hotkey handlers are functions
- Plugin definitions follow the correct structure

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Valid plugin
const myPlugin: Plugin = (editor) => ({
  name: 'my-plugin', // Optional but recommended
  blocks: {
    myBlock: {
      snippet: myBlockSnippet,
      void: false
    }
  },
  hotkeys: {
    'mod+k': ({ prevent }) => {
      prevent(() => {
        // Custom logic here
      });
    }
  }
});

// ‚ùå Invalid plugin - will be caught and logged
const badPlugin: Plugin = (editor) => ({
  blocks: {
    '': null, // Invalid: empty name and null definition
  },
  hotkeys: {
    'mod+k': 'not a function' // Invalid: must be a function
  }
});
```

#### Error Boundaries

Plugin errors are automatically caught and logged without crashing the editor:

- **Initialization errors**: Plugins that fail to initialize are marked as failed and excluded from operation
- **Runtime errors**: Errors in plugin hooks (onBeforeOperation, onChange, etc.) are caught and logged
- **Hotkey errors**: Errors in hotkey handlers are caught while preserving prevention behavior

#### Plugin Status Monitoring

You can monitor plugin status using the built-in methods:

```typescript
// Check if a plugin is active
const status = editor.getPluginStatus('my-plugin'); // 'active' | 'failed' | 'disabled'

// Get plugin error details
const error = editor.getPluginError('my-plugin');

// Get all active plugins
const activePlugins = editor.getActivePlugins();

// Get all failed plugins
const failedPlugins = editor.getFailedPlugins();
```

#### Best Practices for Plugin Development

1. **Always provide a plugin name** for easier debugging:
   ```typescript
   export const myPlugin: Plugin = (editor) => ({
     name: 'my-plugin',
     // ... plugin definitions
   });
   ```

2. **Handle errors gracefully** in your plugin operations:
   ```typescript
   onBeforeOperation: ({ operation, payload, prevent }) => {
     try {
       // Your logic here
       if (shouldPrevent) {
         prevent(() => {
           // Custom behavior
         });
       }
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Plugin operation failed:', error);
       // Don't re-throw unless you want to prevent the operation
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Use TypeScript** for better type safety and validation

4. **Test your plugins** with both valid and invalid inputs

#### Troubleshooting Plugin Issues

**Plugin not loading:**
- Check browser console for initialization errors
- Verify plugin structure matches the Plugin type
- Ensure all required properties are properly defined

**Plugin operations not working:**
- Check if plugin status is 'active' using `getPluginStatus()`
- Look for runtime errors in browser console
- Verify operation hooks are properly implemented

**Hotkeys not responding:**
- Check for hotkey conflicts between plugins
- Verify hotkey syntax follows the HotKeyCombination type
- Ensure hotkey handlers don't throw unhandled errors

**Performance issues:**
- Avoid heavy computations in frequently called hooks like `onChange`
- Use debouncing for expensive operations
- Profile plugin performance using browser dev tools
